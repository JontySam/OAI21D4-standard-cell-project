# OAI21D4 Standard Cell Design Project

## 1. Overview

This repository contains the design and verification files for an OAI21D4 (OR-AND-Invert) standard cell. The project was completed as a requirement for the EE5324 VLSI Design-II course. It encompasses the entire design flow from schematic entry to physical layout and verification.

## 2. Project Goal

The objective of this project is to design a standalone OAI21D4 standard cell using the TSMC 16nm FinFET process. The final deliverable is a verified layout that is DRC and LVS clean and is suitable for integration into a larger digital design.

## 3. Cell Logic

The OAI21D4 cell implements the following Boolean function:

`Z = NOT((A1 OR A2) AND B)`

## 4. Design Specifications

*   **Technology:** TSMC 16nm (N16ADFP) PDK
*   **Tools Used:**
    *   Cadence Virtuoso (Schematic and Layout Editor)
    *   HSPICE (Circuit Simulator)
    *   Calibre (for DRC and LVS)
*   **Transistor Sizing:** All PMOS and NMOS transistors were sized with 4 fins.
*   **Operating Corner:** Typical corner simulations were used.

## 5. Design and Verification Flow

The project followed a standard cell design methodology:

1.  **Schematic Entry:** A transistor-level schematic was created in Cadence Virtuoso. The pull-up network consists of two PMOS transistors (for inputs A1, A2) in series, which are in parallel with a third PMOS (for input B). The pull-down network uses two parallel NMOS transistors (A1, A2) in series with a third NMOS (B).

2.  **Pre-Layout Simulation:** The schematic was simulated using HSPICE to verify its logical correctness. A testbench was created to cycle through all 8 input combinations. A Fanout-of-4 (FO4) load was applied to the output to simulate a realistic load condition.

3.  **Layout Design:** The physical layout was created in Virtuoso Layout XL. The layout adheres to the `N16ADFP_StdCell` library conventions for cell height, power rail (VDD/VSS) structure, and I/O pin placement.

4.  **Layout Verification:**
    *   **DRC (Design Rule Check):** The layout was checked for violations against the TSMC 16nm design rules.
    *   **LVS (Layout Versus Schematic):** The extracted netlist from the layout was compared against the original schematic to ensure they were identical.

5.  **Array Test:** A 3x3 array of the cell was constructed and checked for DRC violations to ensure the cell could be placed in a row (tiled) without generating errors.

## 6. Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
OAI21D4_VD2Project1/
├── OAI21D4BWP16P90/            # Contains the core cell design
│   ├── layout/                 # Layout view of the OAI21D4 cell
│   ├── schematic/              # Schematic view of the OAI21D4 cell
│   └── symbol/                 # Symbol view of the OAI21D4 cell

    └── testbench netlist files/ # HSPICE netlists for simulation
```
*(Note: This is a simplified view. The directories contain various `.oa`, `.dm`, and other files generated by the EDA tools.)*

## 7. Verification Results

*   **Functionality:** Pre-layout simulations confirmed that the cell's output matches the expected truth table for all input combinations.
*   **DRC:** The final layout of the single cell is DRC clean, with the exception of specific, documented waivers (e.g., `PO.S.16`, `PP.W.1.T`) as permitted by the project guidelines for standalone cells. These are expected to be resolved when the cell is placed in a full-chip context with tap and filler cells.
*   **LVS:** The layout is LVS clean, indicating a correct and complete match with the schematic.
